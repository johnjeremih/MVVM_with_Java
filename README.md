# MVVM with Java 


# Description

# Intended User

This app is for developers to learn how to use the new technologies for android using the Java language.

# Features 


*   ViewBinding is being utilized with save a lot of code if you are used to use ButterKnife or FindViewById.

# Key Considerations 


### **How will your app handle data persistence? ** 

   This project uses LiveData


### **Describe any libraries you'll be using and share your reasoning for including them.**



*   RecyclerView
*   Navigation Component
*   Material Design
